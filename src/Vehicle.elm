        The i3 was BMW's first mass-produced EV, and over 130,000 cars have been sold 
        around the world.

        Most of the car body is made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic. 

        The i3 has rear-hinged rear doors to ease entry into the back seats. 

        This model has had three revisions. It started out with a 22 kWh battery and
        a range of 130 km. In 2017, the battery was upgraded to 33 kWh, extending the 
        range to 183 km. In 2019, the battery capacity was increased again to 42 kWh, 
        providing a range of 246 km.

        Over 45,000 cars have been sold worldwide.

        The Peugeot variant is higher spec.

        The 10.5 kWh and 14.5 kWh batteries available on some of the Japanese imports 
        use the lithium titanate oxide SCiB battery technology, allowing them to withstand
        2.5 times more charge`/`discharge cycles, and provide 1.7 times more driving range 
        than a regular Li-ion battery. SCiB batteries can also be charged rapidly, reaching
        80% capacity in 15 minutes. The 16 kWh battery is a regular Li-ion battery.
